Goal: Implementation of a System that can create an internal model of a building complex at room scale resolution and track the amount of people in each room within reasonable accuracy. Additionally, the System to be developed needs to be able to track the distance of inhabitants to each other at certain areas of interests and ring an alarm in case a minimum safety distance is not met.

To reach this Goal we create a Room-Surveillance-Sensor and a Passageway-Surveillance-Sensor.
